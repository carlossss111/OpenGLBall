# So-far-unnamed Graphics Project

The aim of this project is to use OpenGL to render a ball, a platform and maybe some scenery.
The level should tilt to roll the ball, like the game Super Monkey Ball.
It would be cool to add PBR and point shadows and stuff too. Let's see how it goes.

## Compiling
The project is compiled with CMake version >= 3.8.
### Windows
